<h1>Blog Header Component</h1>

<p>The Header component is a crucial part of the blog application's user interface. It provides navigation links, search functionality, and other essential features for users to interact with the blog.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Navigation Links:</strong> The header includes links to different pages of the blog, such as Home, About, and Projects. These links allow users to easily navigate between different sections of the blog.</li>
  <li><strong>Search:</strong> The header contains a search bar where users can input keywords to search for specific content within the blog. The search functionality helps users find relevant information quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Dark Mode Toggle:</strong> Users have the option to toggle between light and dark modes using the dark mode button in the header. This feature enhances user experience by providing a customizable viewing experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign-In:</strong> The header includes a button for users to sign in to their accounts. This allows registered users to access additional features or restricted content within the blog.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>React:</strong> The header component is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture, making it easy to manage and reuse UI elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Flowbite-React:</strong> Styling and layout for the header are implemented using components from the Flowbite-React library. This library offers pre-designed UI components and utilities for building responsive web applications.</li>
  <li><strong>React Router DOM:</strong> Navigation within the blog is facilitated by the React Router DOM library. It enables declarative routing for React applications, allowing seamless navigation between different pages without full-page reloads.</li>
